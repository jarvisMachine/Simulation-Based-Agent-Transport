This project is a traffic simulations through intelligents agents that control the cycles of traffics
light according to vehicular flow. The project is made in Netlogo 5.3.1 with the FIPA library for the
communications.

This folder have three files:

1) EscenarioEstativo: This file have the code for the simmulation of the classic scenarie, that is
 to say, traffics light with static time. 

2) EscenarioDinamico: This file contains the code for to the simmularion of the dinamic traffics
traffics light, that is to say, with agents intelligents.

3) Communications.nls: library for to communications (FIPA)
